# Sign in with Apple \(identity pools\)<a name="apple"></a>

Amazon Cognito integrates with Sign in with Apple to provide federated authentication for your mobile application and web application users\. This section explains how to register and set up your application using Sign in with Apple as an identity provider \(IdP\)\.

To add Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider to an identity pool, you must complete two procedures\. First, integrate Sign in with Apple in an application, and then configure Sign in with Apple in identity pools\. 

## Set up Sign in with Apple<a name="login-with-apple-setup"></a>

To configure Sign in with Apple as an IdP, register your application with the Apple to receive client ID\.

1. Create a [developer account with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)\.

1. [Sign in](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/welcome) with your Apple credentials\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Certificates, IDs & Profiles**\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Identifiers**\.

1. On the **Identifiers** page, choose the **\+**icon\.

1. On the **Register a New Identifier** page, choose **App IDs**, and then choose **Continue**\.

1. On the **Register an App ID** page, do the following:

   1. Under **Description**, type a description\.

   1. Under **Bundle ID,** type an identifier\. Make a note of this **Bundle ID** as you need this value to configure Apple as a provider in the identity pool\. 

   1. Under **Capabilities**, choose **Sign In with Apple**, and then choose **Edit**\.

   1. On the **Sign in with Apple: App ID Configuration** page, select the appropriate setting for you app\. Then choose **Save**\.

   1. Choose **Continue**\.

1. On the **Confirm your App ID** page, choose **Register**\.

1. Proceed to step 10 if you want to integrate Sign in with Apple with a native iOS application\. Step 11 is for applications that you want to integrate with Sign in with Apple JS\.

1. On the **Identifiers** page, choose the **App IDs** menu, then **Services IDs**\. Choose the **\+** icon\.

1. On the **Register a New Identifier** page, choose **Services IDs**, and then choose **Continue**\.

1. On the **Register a Services ID** page, do the following:

   1. Under **Description**, type a description\.

   1. Under **Identifier**, type an identifier\. Make a note of the services ID as you need this value to configure Apple as a provider in your identity pool\. 

   1. Select **Sign In with Apple** and then choose **Configure**\.

   1. On the **Web Authentication Configuration** page, choose a **Primary App ID**\. Under **Website URLs**, choose the **\+ **icon\. For **Domains and Subdomains**, enter the domain name of your app\. In **Return URLs,** enter the callback URL where the authorization redirects the user after they authenticate through Sign in with Apple\. 

   1. Choose **Next**\.

   1. Choose **Continue**, and then choose **Register**\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Keys**\.

1. On the **Keys** page, choose the **\+** icon\.

1. On the **Register a New Key** page, do the following:

   1. Under **Key Name**, type a key name\. 

   1. Choose **Sign In with Apple**, and then choose **Configure**\.

   1. On the **Configure Key** page, choose a **Primary App ID** and then choose **Save**\.

   1. Choose **Continue**, and then choose **Register**\.

1. Choose the **Apple** tab\.

1. Enter the Bundle ID that you obtained from https://developer\.apple\.com\. Then choose **Save Changes\.**

1. If you use Sign in with Apple with native iOS applications, enter the `BundleID` you obtained from developer\.apple\.com\. If you use Sign in with Apple with web or other applications, enter the service ID\. Then choose **Save Changes**\.

## Sign in with Apple as a provider in the Amazon Cognito federated identities CLI examples<a name="sign-in-with-apple-cli-examples"></a>

This example creates an identity pool named `MyIdentityPool` with Sign in with Apple as an IdP\.

`aws cognito-identity create-identity-pool --identity-pool-name MyIdentityPool --supported-login-providers appleid.apple.com="sameple.apple.clientid"`

 For more information, see [Create identity pool]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-identity/create-identity-pool.html) 

**Generate an Amazon Cognito identity ID**  
 This example generates \(or retrieves\) an Amazon Cognito ID\. This is a public API so you don't need any credentials to call this API\.

`aws cognito-identity get-id --identity-pool-id SampleIdentityPoolId --logins appleid.apple.com="SignInWithAppleIdToken"`

For more information, see [get\-id\.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-identity/get-id.html) 

**Get credentials for an Amazon Cognito identity ID**  
This example returns credentials for the provided identity ID and Sign in with Apple login\. This is a public API so you don't need any credentials to call this API\.

`aws cognito-identity get-credentials-for-identity --identity-id SampleIdentityId --logins appleid.apple.com="SignInWithAppleIdToken" `

For more information, see [get\-credentials\-for\-identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-identity/get-credentials-for-identity.html) 

## Use Sign in with Apple: Android<a name="set-up-apple-1.android"></a>

Apple doesn't provide an SDK that supports Sign in with Apple for Android\. You can use the web flow in a web view instead\.
+ To configure Sign in with Apple in your application, follow [Configuring Your Web page for Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/configuring_your_webpage_for_sign_in_with_apple) in the Apple documentation\.
+ To add a **Sign in with Apple** button to your Android user interface, follow [Displaying and Configuring Sign In with Apple Buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/displaying_and_configuring_sign_in_with_apple_buttons) in the Apple documentation\.

Sign in with Apple uses a session object to track its state\. Amazon Cognito uses the ID token from this session object to authenticate the user, generate the unique identifier, and, if needed, grant the user access to other AWS resources\.

```
@Override
public void onSuccess(Bundle response) {
    String token = response.getString("id_token");
    Map<String, String> logins = new HashMap<String, String>();
    logins.put("appleid.apple.com", token);
    credentialsProvider.setLogins(logins);
}
```

## Use Sign in with Apple: iOS \- Objective\-C<a name="set-up-apple-1.ios-objc"></a>

Amazon Cognito uses the ID token to authenticate the user, generate the unique identifier, and, if needed, grant the user access to other AWS resources\.

```
(void)finishedWithAuth: (ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential *)auth error: (NSError *) error {
        NSString *idToken = [ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential objectForKey:@"identityToken"];
        credentialsProvider.logins = @{ "appleid.apple.com": idToken };
    }
```

## Use Sign in with Apple: iOS \- Swift<a name="set-up-apple-1.ios-swift"></a>

Apple provided SDK support for Sign in with Apple in native iOS applications\.

    if error != nil {
      print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
    else {
      let idToken = auth.identityToken,
      credentialsProvider.logins = ["appleid.apple.com": idToken!]
    }
}
```

## Use Sign in with Apple: JavaScript<a name="set-up-apple-1.javascript"></a>

Apple doesnâ€™t provide an SDK that supports Sign in with Apple for JavaScript\. You can use the web flow in a web view instead\.
+ To configure Sign in with Apple in your application, follow [Configuring Your Web page for Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/configuring_your_webpage_for_sign_in_with_apple) in the Apple documentation\.
+ To add a **Sign in with Apple** button to your JavaScript user interface, follow [Displaying and Configuring Sign In with Apple Buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/displaying_and_configuring_sign_in_with_apple_buttons) in the Apple documentation\.
+ To securely authenticate users through Sign in with Apple, follow [Configuring Your Web page for Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/authenticating_users_with_sign_in_with_apple) in the Apple documentation\.

Sign in with Apple uses a session object to track its state\. Amazon Cognito uses the ID token from this session object to authenticate the user, generate the unique identifier, and, if needed, grant the user access to other AWS resources\.

```
function signinCallback(authResult) {
     // Add the apple's id token to the Amazon Cognito credentials login map.
     AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
        IdentityPoolId: 'IDENTITY_POOL_ID',
        Logins: {
           'appleid.apple.com': authResult['id_token']
        }
     });

     // Obtain AWS credentials
     AWS.config.credentials.get(function(){
        // Access AWS resources here.
     });
}
```

## Use Sign in with Apple: Xamarin<a name="set-up-apple-1.xamarin"></a>

We donâ€™t have an SDK that supports Sign in with Apple for Xamarin\. You can use the web flow in a web view instead\.
+ To configure Sign in with Apple in your application, follow [Configuring Your Web page for Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/configuring_your_webpage_for_sign_in_with_apple) in the Apple documentation\.
+ To add a **Sign in with Apple** button to your Xamarin user interface, follow [Displaying and Configuring Sign In with Apple Buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/displaying_and_configuring_sign_in_with_apple_buttons) in the Apple documentation\.
+ To securely authenticate users through Sign in with Apple, follow [Configuring Your Web page for Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/authenticating_users_with_sign_in_with_apple) in the Apple documentation\.

Sign in with Apple uses a session object to track its state\. Amazon Cognito uses the ID token from this session object to authenticate the user, generate the unique identifier, and, if needed, grant the user access to other AWS resources\.

After you have the token, you can set it in your `CognitoAWSCredentials`:

```
credentials.AddLogin("appleid.apple.com", token);
```
