# Configuring a user pool domain<a name="cognito-user-pools-assign-domain"></a>

After setting up an app client, you can configure the address of your sign\-up and sign\-in webpages\. You can use an Amazon Cognito hosted domain and choose an available domain prefix, or you can use your own web address as a custom domain\.

To add an app client and an Amazon Cognito hosted domain with the AWS Management Console, see [ Adding an app to enable the hosted web UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-configuring-app-integration.html)\.

**Note**  
You can't use the text `aws`, `amazon`, or `cognito` in the domain prefix\.
