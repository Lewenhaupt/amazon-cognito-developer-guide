# Revoke endpoint<a name="revocation-endpoint"></a>

The /`oauth2/revoke` endpoint revokes a user's access token that Amazon Cognito initially issued with the refresh token that you provide, and all subsequent access tokens from the same refresh token\. After the endpoint revokes the tokens, you can't use the revoked tokens to access APIs that Amazon Cognito tokens authenticate\.

## POST /oauth2/revoke<a name="post-revoke"></a>

The `/oauth2/revoke` endpoint only supports `HTTPS POST`\. The user pool client makes requests to this endpoint directly and not through the system browser\.

### Request parameters in header<a name="revocation-request-parameters"></a>

*Authorization*  
If your app client has a client secret, the app must pass its `client_id` and `client_secret` in the authorization header through Basic HTTP authorization\. The secret is [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side) `Base64Encode(client_id:client_secret)`\.

*Content\-Type*  
Must always be `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`\.

#### Request parameters in body<a name="revocation-request-parameters-body"></a>

*token*  
The refresh token that the client wants to revoke\. The request also revokes all access tokens that Amazon Cognito issued with this refresh token\.  
Required\.

*client\_id*  
The app client ID for the token that you want to revoke\.  
Required if the client is public and doesn't have a secret\.

##### Revocation error response<a name="revoke-sample-response"></a>

A successful response contains an empty body\. The error response is a JSON object with an `error` field and, in some cases, an `error_description` field\.
