Now that you've created a user pool, you can explore more of the features in Amazon Cognito

Dive deep into these user pool features:
+ [Customizing the built\-in sign\-in and sign\-up webpages](cognito-user-pools-app-ui-customization.md)
+ [Adding MFA to a user pool](user-pool-settings-mfa.md)
+ [Adding advanced security to a user pool](cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.md)
+ [Customizing user pool workflows with Lambda triggers](cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.md)
+ [Using Amazon Pinpoint analytics with Amazon Cognito user pools](cognito-user-pools-pinpoint-integration.md)

For an overview of Amazon Cognito authentication and authorization cases, see [Common Amazon Cognito scenarios](cognito-scenarios.md)\.

To access other AWS services after a successful user pool authentication, see [Accessing AWS services using an identity pool after sign\-in](amazon-cognito-integrating-user-pools-with-identity-pools.md)\.

In addition to the AWS Management Console and the user pool SDKs mentioned previously in this section, you can also interact with your user pool profiles by using the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/index.html)\.
