# Checking for compromised credentials<a name="cognito-user-pool-settings-compromised-credentials"></a>

Amazon Cognito can detect if a user's user name and password have been compromised elsewhere\. This can happen when users reuse credentials at more than one site, or when they use insecure passwords\. Amazon Cognito checks *native users* who sign in with user name and password, in the hosted UI and with the Amazon Cognito API\. Native users are users who you created or who signed up in the Amazon Cognito directory without a federated identity provider \(IdP\)\.

From **Advanced security** in the **App integration** tab of the Amazon Cognito console, you can configure **Compromised credentials**\. Configure **Event detection** to choose the user events that you want to monitor for compromised credentials\. Configure **Compromised credentials responses** to choose whether to allow or block the user if compromised credentials are detected\. Amazon Cognito can check for compromised credentials during sign\-in, sign\-up, and password changes\.

When you choose **Allow sign\-in**, you can review Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor the evaluations that Amazon Cognito makes on user events\. For more information, see [Viewing advanced security metrics](user-pool-settings-viewing-advanced-security-metrics.md)\. When you choose **Block sign\-in**, Amazon Cognito prevents sign\-in by users who use compromised credentials\. When Amazon Cognito blocks sign\-in for a user, it sets the user's [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_UserType.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_UserType.html) to `RESET_REQUIRED`\. A user with a `RESET_REQUIRED` status must change their password before they can sign in again\.

**Note**  
Currently, Amazon Cognito doesn't check for compromised credentials for sign\-in operations with Secure Remote Password \(SRP\) flow, which doesn't send the password during sign\-in\. Amazon Cognito checks sign\-ins that use the [AdminInitiateAuth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminInitiateAuth.html) API with `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow, and the [InitiateAuth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_InitiateAuth.html) API with `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow, for compromised credentials\.
