# Adding cost allocation tags to your user pool<a name="cognito-user-pools-cost-allocation-tagging"></a>

**Note**  
In the new Amazon Cognito console experience, you can manage tags in the **User pool properties** tab of your user pool\.

In the **Tags** tab, you can add cost allocation tags to categorize and track your AWS costs\. When you apply tags to your AWS resources, such as Amazon Cognito user pools, your AWS cost allocation report includes usage and costs aggregated by tags\. You can apply tags that represent business categories such as cost centers, application names, and owners, to organize your costs across multiple services\. For more information, see [Using cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing User Guide*\.

To add a tag, choose **Add tag**\. Specify a **Tag key** and **Tag value**, following the restrictions listed in [Tag restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html)\. Choose **Save changes** to save your tag\.

**Important**  
In order for tags to appear on your billing reports, you must activate your applied tags in the billing console\. For more information, see [Activating user\-defined cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing User Guide*\.
