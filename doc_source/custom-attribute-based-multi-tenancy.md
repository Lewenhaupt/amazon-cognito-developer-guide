# Custom\-attribute\-based multi\-tenancy<a name="custom-attribute-based-multi-tenancy"></a>

With custom\-attribute\-based multi\-tenancy, you can store tenant identification data like `tenant_id` as a [ custom attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-custom-attributes) in a user’s profile\. You then handle all multi\-tenancy logic in your application and backend services\. With this approach, you can use a unified sign\-up and sign\-in experience for all users\. To identify the user’s tenant in your application, you can check this custom attribute\.
