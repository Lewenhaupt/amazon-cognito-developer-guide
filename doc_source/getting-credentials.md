# Getting credentials<a name="getting-credentials"></a>

You can use Amazon Cognito to deliver temporary, limited\-privilege credentials to your application, so that your users can access AWS resources\. This section describes how to get credentials and how to retrieve an Amazon Cognito identity from an identity pool\.

Amazon Cognito supports both authenticated and unauthenticated identities\. Unauthenticated users do not have their identity verified, making this role appropriate for guest users of your app or in cases when it doesn't matter if users have their identities verified\. Authenticated users log in to your application through a third\-party identity provider, or a user pool, that verifies their identities\. Make sure you scope the permissions of resources appropriately so you don't grant access to them from unauthenticated users\.

Amazon Cognito identities are not credentials\. They are exchanged for credentials using web identity federation support in the AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\)\. The recommended way to obtain AWS credentials for your app users is to use `AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials`\. The identity in the credentials object is then exchanged for credentials using AWS STS\.

**Note**  
If you created your identity pool before February 2015, you must reassociate your roles with your identity pool in order to use the `AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials` constructor without the roles as parameters\. To do so, open the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home), choose **Manage identity pools**, select your identity pool, choose **Edit identity Pool**, specify your authenticated and unauthenticated roles, and save the changes\.

You can use Amazon Cognito to deliver temporary, limited\-privilege credentials to your application, so that your users can access AWS resources\. Amazon Cognito supports both authenticated and unauthenticated identities\. To provide AWS credentials to your app, follow the steps below\.

1. Choose **Manage identity pools** from the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home), create an identity pool, and copy the starter code snippets\. 

1.  If you haven't already done so, add the AWS Mobile SDK for Android to your project\. For instructions, see [Set Up the Mobile SDK for Android](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/setup.html)\. 

1.  Include the following import statements: 

   ```
   import com.amazonaws.auth.CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider;
   import com.amazonaws.regions.Regions;
   ```

1.  Initialize the Amazon Cognito credentials provider using the code snippet generated by the Amazon Cognito console\. The value for `IDENTITY_POOL_ID` will be specific to your account: 

   ```
   CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider(
     getApplicationContext(), // Context
     "IDENTITY_POOL_ID", // Identity Pool ID
     Regions.US_EAST_1 // Region
   );
   ```

1.  Pass the initialized Amazon Cognito credentials provider to the constructor of the AWS client to be used\. The code required depends on the service to be initialized\. The client will use this provider to get credentials with which it will access AWS resources\. 
**Note**  
 If you created your identity pool before February 2015, you must reassociate your roles with your identity pool in order to use this constructor without the roles as parameters\. To do so, open the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home), choose **Manage Federated Identies**, select your identity pool, and choose **Edit identity Pool**, specify your authenticated and unauthenticated roles, and save the changes\. 

**Retrieving an Amazon Cognito identity**

If you're allowing unauthenticated users, you can retrieve a unique Amazon Cognito identifier \(identity ID\) for your end user immediately\. If you're authenticating users, you can retrieve the identity ID after you've set the login tokens in the credentials provider:

```
String identityId = credentialsProvider.getIdentityId();
Log.d("LogTag", "my ID is " + identityId);
```

**Note**  
 Do not call `getIdentityId()`, `refresh()`, or `getCredentials()` in the main thread of your application\. As of Android 3\.0 \(API Level 11\), your app will automatically fail and throw a [NetworkOnMainThreadException](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/NetworkOnMainThreadException.html) if you perform network I/O on the main application thread\. You must move your code to a background thread using `AsyncTask`\. For more information, consult the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/connecting.html#AsyncTask)\. You can also call `getCachedIdentityId()` to retrieve an ID, but only if one is already cached locally\. Otherwise, the method will return null\.

You can use Amazon Cognito to deliver temporary, limited\-privilege credentials to your application, so that your users can access AWS resources\. Amazon Cognito identity pools support both authenticated and unauthenticated identities\. To provide AWS credentials to your app, follow the steps below\. 

1. Choose **Manage identity pools** from the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home), create an identity pool, and copy the starter code snippets\. 

1.  If you haven't already done so, add the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS to your project\. For instructions, see [Set Up the Mobile SDK for iOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/setup.html)\. 

1.  In your source code, include the AWSCore header: 

   ```
   #import <AWSCore/AWSCore.h>
   ```

1.  Initialize the Amazon Cognito credentials provider using the code snippet generated by the Amazon Cognito console\. The value for `IDENTITY_POOL_ID` will be specific to your account: 

   ```
   AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider *credentialsProvider = [[AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider alloc]
   initWithRegionType:AWSRegionUSEast1 identityPoolId:@"IDENTITY_POOL_ID"];
   AWSServiceConfiguration *configuration = [[AWSServiceConfiguration alloc]
   initWithRegion:AWSRegionUSEast1 credentialsProvider:credentialsProvider];
   AWSServiceManager.defaultServiceManager.defaultServiceConfiguration = configuration;
   ```
**Note**  
 If you created your identity pool before February 2015, you must reassociate your roles with your identity pool in order to use this constructor without the roles as parameters\. To do so, open the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home), choose **Manage identity pools**, select your identity pool, choose **Edit identity Pool**, specify your authenticated and unauthenticated roles, and save the changes\. 

**Retrieving an Amazon Cognito identity**

You can retrieve a unique Amazon Cognito identifier \(identity ID\) for your end user immediately if you're allowing unauthenticated users or after you've set the login tokens in the credentials provider if you're authenticating users:

```
// Retrieve your Amazon Cognito ID
[[credentialsProvider getIdentityId] continueWithBlock:^id(AWSTask *task) {
    if (task.error) {
        NSLog(@"Error: %@", task.error);
    }
    else {
        // the task result will contain the identity id
        NSString *cognitoId = task.result;
    }
    return nil;
}];
```

**Note**  
 `getIdentityId` is an asynchronous call\. If an identity ID is already set on your provider, you can call `credentialsProvider.identityId` to retrieve that identity, which is cached locally\. However, if an identity ID is not set on your provider, calling `credentialsProvider.identityId` will return `nil`\. For more information, consult the [Amplify iOS SDK reference](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios)\.

## JavaScript<a name="getting-credentials-1.javascript"></a>

If you have not yet created one, create an identity pool in the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito) before using `AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials`\.

After you configure an identity pool with your identity providers, you can use `AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials` to authenticate users\. To configure your application credentials to use `AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials`, set the `credentials` property of either `AWS.Config` or a per\-service configuration\. The following example uses `AWS.Config`: 

```
// Set the region where your identity pool exists (us-east-1, eu-west-1)
AWS.config.region = 'us-east-1';

// Configure the credentials provider to use your identity pool
AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
    IdentityPoolId: 'IDENTITY_POOL_ID',
    Logins: { // optional tokens, used for authenticated login
        'graph.facebook.com': 'FBTOKEN',
        'www.amazon.com': 'AMAZONTOKEN',
        'accounts.google.com': 'GOOGLETOKEN',
        'appleid.apple.com': 'APPLETOKEN'
    }
});

// Make the call to obtain credentials
AWS.config.credentials.get(function(){

    // Credentials will be available when this function is called.
    var accessKeyId = AWS.config.credentials.accessKeyId;
    var secretAccessKey = AWS.config.credentials.secretAccessKey;
    var sessionToken = AWS.config.credentials.sessionToken;

});
```

The optional `Logins` property is a map of identity provider names to the identity tokens for those providers\. How you get the token from your identity provider depends on the provider you use\. For example, if Facebook is one of your identity providers, you might use the `FB.login` function from the [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web) to get an identity provider token: 

```
FB.login(function (response) {
    if (response.authResponse) { // logged in
        AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
          IdentityPoolId: 'us-east-1:1699ebc0-7900-4099-b910-2df94f52a030',
          Logins: {
            'graph.facebook.com': response.authResponse.accessToken
          }
        });

        console.log('You are now logged in.');
    } else {
        console.log('There was a problem logging you in.');
    }
});
```
